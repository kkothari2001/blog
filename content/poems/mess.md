    I don't know what to say anymore,
    or what to do either.
    I sit on the edge of the bed,
    shaking.

    Head down, hands in the air;
    a gentle violin playing I know not where.
    I have almost given up.

    In the background people scream celebrating the new year,
    I frown cause I know I haven't lived the past year.

    I know I'm a mess.
    But I don't care.
    I've found peace at last;
    and the past has passed.
