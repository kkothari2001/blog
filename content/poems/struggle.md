    I push through the city,
    through the mist,
    through the uncertainty,
    slowly going through the checklist.

    I agree I'm slow,
    but I'm working hard.
    Through the webs of doubt,
    and jungles of distraction,
    I know I'll grow.

    My progress seems miniscule,
    in the face of ridicule.
    But the din doesn't stop me anymore.
    Cause I know the day will come,
    when the hyenas won't sneer anymore.
