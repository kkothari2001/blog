    A moment ago, I held your hand.
    And as I pull you closer,
    you disappear.

    I sigh, for I'm tired.
    Tired of these dreams;
    mingling into reality.

    All the time wasted,
    all the achievements I've dreamt of,
    they taunt me.

    Binding my brain in chains is what I've tried,
    but it wishes to fly.
    Fly like the wind.
    But after all the wind too erodes mountains;
    erodes my brain, for I know not what is real anymore.
