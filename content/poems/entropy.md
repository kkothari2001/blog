    Life's a mess.
    So is my hair.

    Can't really help it.
    I don't really care.

    Assignments and whatnot keep me busy.
    Else my brain keeps wandering God knows where.

    The entropy in my life is ever increasing;
    in coding and poems, I get my kicks.

    Holding it back won't help.
    Afterall, it's the second law of thermodynamics.
