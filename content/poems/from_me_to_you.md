    You've been distracted,
    disturbed,
    sore,
    and perturbed.

    You've got potential,
    lots and lots of it.
    It's just your path that's tangential.
    The road is set in yellow brick,
    please don't wander from it.

    You've conquered your demons well,
    that I can agree.
    But buckle up!
    For there's no time to sightsee.

    Fill yourself with vigour,
    and don't let yourself down.
    Cause now is the time for grandeur,
    not the time to get knocked down.

    For afterall the sea of life is choppy,
    and there's no guessing the next tsunami.
