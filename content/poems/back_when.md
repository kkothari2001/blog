    Back when tigers roamed the bushes,
    and tiny soldiers marched the window sill.
    Back when you lived on Candy Island,
    and you could spend hours prodding the anthill.

    I remember those moments of pure ecstasy,
    punctuated with Rasna breaks.
    I remember those moments of thrill,
    of cycling down hills without breaks.

    You could say I've changed a lot;
    become less energetic and more mature.
    But for the whirlwind that life is,
    I guess being a kid again is the only cure.
