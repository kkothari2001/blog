## Through hardships to the stars

    I know about my patchy beard,
    and about my crooked smile.

    Ah! Thanks for reminding me of my scraggly hair once again.
    It really has been a while.

    My unfunny jokes you do remember,
    and my atrocious voice too.

    You remember my lopsided run!
    What a surprise!
    You ask if I have any shortcomings?
    None.
