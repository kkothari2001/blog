    Beauty matching only to the Euler's Identity,
    she fills me up with a unique serenity.

    Her curves I would integrate,
    Lmao sorry that was inappropriate ðŸ˜‚

    Distance is relative,
    and our minds entangled.
    But our connection is delative,
    I think I'm being triangled.

    My love for her is like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.
    Sometimes I like her to infinity,
    and sometimes I hate that stupid brat.

    I wouldn't normally have cared,
    but on a scale of 1 to 10,
    I'm e and she's pi squared.
