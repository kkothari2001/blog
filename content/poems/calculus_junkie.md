    In a room of boys with rolled up sleeves,
    I'm the one who prefers them down.

    I'll ask not who you were talking to right now,
    just how your day has been. :) Neither will I reply to your text promptly,
    nor will I leave you at seen.

    Am not a protein hunkie, neither a Dubstep funkie,
    just a calculus junkie.
