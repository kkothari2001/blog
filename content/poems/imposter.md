    I'm jealous.
    Jealous of the person who dreams my dreams,
    who stakes my claims,
    and feels pride on my behalf,
    for I'm not what he claims to be.

    The feeling....
    uuugh that strange feeling.
    I'm not me anymore,
    in fact I never was.

    The person I am is distant,
    detached;
    waiting eons for a moment.
    A moment that may never come.
    The moment I take this mask off.
