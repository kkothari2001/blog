    I have heard Krishna's flute in the most silent of times,
    and Shiva's feet in the darkest.

    I have heard Ganesha trumpeting whenever I start something new,
    and have felt Saraswati's warmth when I've learnt something new.

    Hanuman's chants calm me down,
    all while Brahma's instill within me a fire.

    Ram's story inspires me,
    and so does Arjun's.

    Sometimes I sympathize with Ravana,
    and sometimes with Karna too.

    Yet I don't know if they exist,
    I just hope they do.
