    Change is the only constant, they say.
    It was all that was in my sight.
    I was afraid of it;
    it hounded me day and night.

    They came in packs;
    the slightest of changes were the worst,
    for they sowed the seeds of misery behind my back.
    And suddenly one day I burst.

    I realised,
    that life isn't an ocean to survive in.
    Instead it's merely a river to flow with.
    And only to the closest of friends I should trust in.
    Cause they're the only people I could go with.

    Perhaps not much has changed.
    Perhaps the only thing that has changed is,
    that I've learnt to embrace the change.
