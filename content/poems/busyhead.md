    Hey there's a thought!
    And that's another!
    Suddenly I'm surrounded,
    drowning in a never ending flurry.

    Why did she say that?
    Why did he give me that look?
    I don't know.....
    and that kills me.

    Possibilities flood my mind,
    as I ponder over nothingness.
    It's like drowning in the swimming pool of a cruize ship;
    meaningless.

    It's an evil that has taken over me,
    and devoured me alive.
    Or maybe I'm overthinking that too.
